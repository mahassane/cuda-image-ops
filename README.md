Image Processing with CUDA focuses on accelerating fundamental image processing tasks. By leveraging GPU acceleration, the system efficiently processes large-scale images in real time. The approach focuses on optimizing memory access patterns and execution flow to maximize throughput, making it well-suited for applications requiring fast and reliable image processing.

Key Features:

Image convolution

• Data partitioning: Shared Memory tiling.

• Constant memory for masks.

• Multiple streaming.

• Comparing usage of pinned, unified, and pageable memories.

Histogram Computation

• Comparing privitaization vs Atomic adds.
